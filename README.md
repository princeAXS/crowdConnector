Crowd Connector- A business intelligence tool to visualize user activity at a particular location.

I have come across a new technology called “Beacon Technology”. Beacons allow for background positioning and detection, giving new power to a phone using Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. If a user with a particular app installed in his/her phone crosses the range of the beacon. Beacon hits the server with its location and the user action that can be either entering or exiting. So it means server will get the count of users at that particular location. With the help this data and Google maps, we will be able to visualize(heat map concepts or bar graph) number of user at a particular location. In other words, we will have a tool to find hot spot in the city. This kind of information will be very useful in taking business decisions.
